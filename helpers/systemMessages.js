// Choose only one locator that best matches the scenario. Do not invent or modify locators.
// Return only the locator string from the list, with no explanations or line breaks.

// Choose only one locator string from the provided list. Do not combine, modify, or invent locators. Return the locator string exactly as it appears in the list.
// If multiple elements have the same text, use additional attributes (such as tag, class, href, id) from the same object to make the locator unique.
